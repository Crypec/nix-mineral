# nix-mineral
NixOS module for convenient system hardening.
Rather than be named after a mineral, it's named after the word "mineral."

# Scope
Reasonably harden NixOS in a way that can be quickly deployed by the end user. Threat model assumes non-governmental adversaries, anonymity is not considered and some concessions are made for usability/breakage reasons.

# Usage
Import "nix-mineral.nix" into your NixOS config. Edit nix-mineral.nix and adjust accordingly to user needs.
